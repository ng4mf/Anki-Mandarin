# Anki-Mandarin
This deck is for 普通话， i.e., Mandarin. They are cards with characters on one side and pinyin+meaning (in English) on the other side. There are two versions of each card, one version only shows the character and you need to recall the pinyin + meaning, and in the other you need to remember how to write the character.

This assumes you've installed [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

Cards Based on [Integrated Chinese, 4th Edition](https://www.cheng-tsui.com/browse/integrated-chinese-4th-edition)

Unsure if plain text version will create two versions of the cards.
The apkg version should, at least, include two versions: one with front side being character and reverse being pinyin + meaning, and the reverse giving you pinyin and meaning, and you have to practice writing the character.

This repository will be updated over time to include more of the vocabulary from the linked textbooks.

## Labeling of Tags in the Decks

Labels are according to the following format:
* B1 --> Integrated Chinese, Book 1
* B2 --> Integrated Chinese, Book 2
* B3 --> A New Chinese, Revised Edition

Lessons are numbered according to the respective textbook and characters are tagged as "B2-L1-Lesson-Name", indicating Book 2, Lesson 1, Lesson Name.

There is a separate tag called "Encountered" which are words not necessarily in the textbooks, but encountered in talking/writing or otherwise engaging with Mandarin speakers, text, or video. Words not in the text but presented as supplemental material to a text are tagged with the lesson they were supplemental material for.

## Merging future updates
### Option 1
When you first install the deck, rename it to something else. Then, when you wish to install an update, import the updated deck with it's original name. Go to Browse, located near the top-center of the UI. Here, you can see all the cards. Click on the deck you just imported. Select all the new cards you want to import to your renamed deck. Right click and then select "Change deck".

### Option 2
You could import the updated deck as a new (renamed) deck. Then follow steps in https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/87167/how-do-you-merge-decks-in-anki before deleting the newer deck.

You may not want to overwrite the original deck, as that might cause your practice data to be lost.

It's possible you can directly merge decks if you import one of the same name, I'm not sure. This file will be updated once I find out.
