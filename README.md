Cards Based on Integrated Chinese, 4th Edition

Refer to https://www.cheng-tsui.com/browse/integrated-chinese-4th-edition

Unsure if plain text version will create two versions of the cards.
I know the apkg version includes two versions: one with front side being character and reverse being pinyin + meaning, and the reverse giving you pinyin and meaning, and you have to practice writing the character.

This repository will be updated over time to include more of the vocabulary from the linked textbooks.
