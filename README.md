# Anki-Mandarin
Cards Based on Integrated Chinese, 4th Edition

Refer to https://www.cheng-tsui.com/browse/integrated-chinese-4th-edition

Unsure if plain text version will create two versions of the cards.
I know the apkg version includes two versions: one with front side being character and reverse being pinyin + meaning, and the reverse giving you pinyin and meaning, and you have to practice writing the character.

This repository will be updated over time to include more of the vocabulary from the linked textbooks.

## Merging future updates
You could import the updated deck as a new (renamed) deck. Then follow steps in:https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/87167/how-do-you-merge-decks-in-anki before deleting the other deck.

You don't want to overwrite the original deck, as that may cause your practice data to be lost.

It's possible you can directly merge decks if you import one of the same name, I'm not sure. This file will be updated once I find out.
